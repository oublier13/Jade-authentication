This project utilizes mobile devices to capture images of jade artifacts, enabling intelligent recognition and information retrieval. Users simply take photos of jade pieces using smartphones or tablets, and the system leverages advanced image recognition technology to rapidly analyze image features and match them with the corresponding jade information. Meanwhile, the collected data and images are uploaded in real time to a cloud database, providing abundant high-quality training samples for deep learning and continuous optimization of large-scale models.

In terms of system architecture, the project adopts a bidirectional interactive collaborative optimization approach. A lightweight model embedded in the mobile terminal is responsible not only for the rapid collection and preliminary processing of on-site data but also for adjusting the cloud-based large model based on real-time feedback, ensuring that the large model adapts more accurately to specific scenarios. Concurrently, the cloud-based large model employs knowledge distillation techniques to feed back refined features and discriminative capabilities—gained from deep learning and big data training—to the mobile small model, continuously enhancing its recognition speed and accuracy. Additionally, the cloud-based large model undertakes complex tasks such as advanced data analysis, deep semantic understanding, and high-level decision-making, ensuring the system remains efficient and stable even under diverse and complex application scenarios.

Overall, the project establishes a hierarchical, complementary, and collaborative intelligent architecture that harnesses the powerful computational and analytical capabilities of the cloud-based large model while fully exploiting the convenience and rapid responsiveness of the mobile small model, providing users with an efficient, intelligent, and flexible solution for jade artifact recognition and retrieval.

Some images of the data are provided with this project.
